## Team project by Andrew K and Catalyst

##TOC

### Our project 
Rancid Tomatillos is a paird project from module 3 of Turing School of Software & Design. It is a simple web app that displays movie information. The user is able to view a grid of movie posters and click on one to see more information about that movie. One can also sort the movies by select criteria and search for a movie by name.

As our first foray into using React, the coding process started out surprisingly smooth. We were able to get our basic components working without much fuss. Likewise, fetching and displaying API information worked quite well. We ran into trouble as we attempted to implememnt more functions and features. Likewise using Cypress testing was daunting at first, but once we understood how it worked, we were able to write many accurate tests.
